## SUMMARY
This project uses review body and verfied_purchase columns from Amazon Review Dataset to train machine learning models, Simple RNN,Long Short Term Memory Unit (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit(GRU) and test predictions, on Tensorflow platform. 

## Objectives
1. Prepare data for models
    - [x] select text and a label
    - [x] lower the text cases
    - [x] remove not words
    - [x] undersample the data
    - [x] split data into train, test set
2. Build models
    - [x] train and test with Simple RNN
    - [x] train and test with LSTM
    - [x] train and test with GRU
    - [x] compare the results
3. Output formatted data for visual aids
    - [ ] make presentation slides
4. Deploy to the Spark Cluster
    - [x] create spark clusters
    - [ ] rewrite pandas code in pyspark
    - [ ] failure recovery
    - [ ] scale linearly?
